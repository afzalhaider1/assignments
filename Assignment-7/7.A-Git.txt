- Create a folder ninja at the root level of your cloned code
	git clone https://github.com/afzalhaider1/assignment8.git
	git branch
	mkdir ninja
	
- Add a file README.md with content "Trying fast forward merge" in  ninja folder
	echo "Trying fast forward merge" > ninja/README.md
	
- Create a branch ninja and move to it
	git checkout -b ninja
	
- Run git status command
	git status
	
- Commit your changes to ninja branch
	git add ninja/README.md 
	git commit -m "Add README.md to ninja branch"
	
- Merge ninja branch to master branch make sure that a new commit get's created
	git checkout main
	git merge ninja
	
- Assuming you are in the master branch, modify README.md with content "Changes in master branch", commit the changes in master branch.
	echo "Changes in master branch" >> ninja/README.md           
	git add ninja/README.md 
	git commit -m "Modify README.md in master branch"
	git status
	git log
	
- Switch to ninja branch, modify README.md with content "Changes in ninja branch", commit the changes in ninja branch.
	git checkout ninja 
	echo "Changes in ninja branch" >> ninja/README.md
	git add ninja/README.md 
	git commit -m "Modify README.md in ninja branch"
	git log --oneline
	
- Merge the ninja branch to the master branch in such a fashion that a merge conflict is generated and resolve it using the ours and theirs concept so that the changes of the ninja branch overrides changes in master branch.	
	git checkout main
	git merge ninja
	git checkout --ours ninja/README.md
	git add ninja/README.md 
	git commit -m "Merge 'ninja' branch with conflict resolution"
